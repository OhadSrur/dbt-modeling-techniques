{% docs user_active_days %}
Mock input data for active days. We've used a seed here, but you would use your own data to generate a similar table.

Important question to consider: how is an "active" user defined?

Sample data:

| user_id | date_day   | is_active |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| 1       | 2020-08-13 | 1         |
| 1       | 2020-09-01 | 1         |
| 1       | 2020-09-04 | 1         |
| 1       | 2020-09-05 | 1         |
| 1       | 2020-09-12 | 1         |
| 1       | 2020-09-17 | 1         |
| 2       | 2020-09-01 | 1         |
